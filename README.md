 Repository for CUNY Masters in Data Science - Course: Web Analytics (Data 620)

Course Summary:
Organizations, both commercial and community, can benefit from deep analysis of their website interactions and mobile data. Social networks have also become a source of information for companies; search engines are an important referral mechanism. 
Popular social networks and other online communities provide rich sources of user information and (inter-) actions through their application programming interfaces. This data can help to identify a number of individual user preferences and behaviors, as well as fundamental relationships within the community. 
Search engines use algorithms to rank sites. Students will learn how to analyze social network data for types of networks, the fundamental calculations used in social networks (e.g., centrality, cohesion, affiliations, and clustering coefficient) as well as network structures and roles. 
Beyond social network data, students will learn about important concepts of analyzing website traffic such as click streams, referrals, keywords, page views, and drop rates. The course will touch on the fundamentals of search algorithms and search engine optimization. 
To provide a basic context for understanding these online user and community behaviors, students will learn about relevant social science theories such as homophily, social capital, trust, and motivations as well as business and social use contexts. In addition, this course will address ethical and privacy issues as they relate to information on the Internet and social responsibility.

Course Learning Outcomes:
At the end of this course, students will be able to:
•	Analyze text data, including natural language processing and text representation, word association, topic mining, opinion mining and sentiment analysis, and text-based prediction.
•	Perform network analysis, including creating graphs, calculating statistics on nodes, and graph visualization.
•	Work with various social network APIs, including Twitter, Facebook, and Linked In.

Students will be required to:
•	Apply what they learn about network analysis and text mining in a series of increasing complex projects and associated presentations.

How is this course relevant for data analytics professionals?
Text mining is about working with unstructured data.  Network analysis focuses more on relationships than entities.  These are two of the fastest growing sub-fields of data science and are increasingly successful for success in the workplace.
